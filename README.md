# code-brunch-calc

This is a playground project. Used to find all dates for "Code Brunch" and "Innovation Fridays" of
my current company. The Rules are smiple. If there is no holyday then every Software Developer can
go to the code brunch and talk about interesting topics with each other but at the last friday of
the month we can do whatever makes us smarter or helps us to perform Work faster or better.
