        This is a playground project. Used to find all dates for "Code Brunch" and "Innovation
        Fridays" of my current company. The Rules are smiple. If there is no holyday then every
        Software Developer can go to the code brunch and talk about interesting topics with each
        other but at the last friday of the month we can do whatever makes us smarter or helps us
        to perform Work faster or better.
